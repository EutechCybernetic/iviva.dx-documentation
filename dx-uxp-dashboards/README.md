**UXP Dashboards** are interactive, no-code workspaces that allow users to visualize, monitor, and interact with operational data in real-time. Built using configurable **widgets**, each dashboard can be tailored to suit specific business needs—whether it’s tracking facility health, managing assets, or analyzing service performance.

Dashboards are responsive, reusable, and dynamically connected to data sources—enabling both technical and non-technical users to create powerful data experiences without writing a single line of code.
