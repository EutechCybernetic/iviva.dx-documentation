<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/web and mobile (1) (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The **Asset Dashboard** provides a detailed view of an individual asset selected from either the **Portfolio Dashboard** or the **Location Dashboard**. It serves as a central point for accessing critical asset information, lifecycle details, and associated activities—such as work orders, maintenance events, and related documents.

This dashboard enables facility managers and technicians to quickly assess asset status, review operational history, and initiate or monitor maintenance actions.
