The Dashboards section in the iviva.DX mobile app lets you monitor and analyse key business data through dashboards designed for mobile.

Each dashboard is built using **UXP widgets**—customisable components that show real-time insights, from asset performance to facility overviews.

Some examples of dashboards you will find include:

* **Portfolio Overview** – A map view showing how your facilities are spread out
* **Asset Overview** – A summary of assets grouped by location or portfolio
* **Location Overview** – A detailed view of facilities, their areas, and quick actions

You can customise dashboards using the **iviva.DX web application**—pick your widgets, set up layouts, and configure data views to match your needs. The mobile app shows these dashboards as they are set up on the web, but you will not be able to create or edit them from your phone.

These dashboards are dynamic, responsive, and tailored for mobile use—so you can stay informed and take action while you are on the go.

💡 _Tip: Dashboards use the same widgets as the web version,_ so everything stays consistent across platforms.
