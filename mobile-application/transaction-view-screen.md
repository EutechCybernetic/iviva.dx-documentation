The **Transaction View Screen** in the iviva.DX mobile app lets users see all the details of a transaction and work with individual transactions in detail.

### **Transaction Views**

There are **two types of transaction views:**

#### 🔹 With Transition Action Bar

You will see **workflow transitions** as buttons (like Acknowledge or Cancel), and the current stage (_e.g., New_) is clearly shown at the top.

#### 🔹 Without Transition Action Bar

The current stage appears in a **dropdown**.\
Tap it to see the available transitions that you can perform manually.

***

Additional features you will see in both views:

* **QR Code Scanner** – Scan linked items, if it has been configured.
* **Share Link** – Share the transaction outside the app, if sharing enabled.

#### 📂 Side Navigation Menu

Swipe or tap the **hamburger menu** to open a navigation panel with quick links to:

* **Details** (may include configured subsections like _Related Members_, _Issue Location_, _Problem_, etc.)
* **Links**
* **Schedule**
* **Checklists**
* **Attachments**
* **Conversation**
* **SLAs**
* **Transaction History**

💡 _Tip: Use the side menu to jump straight to the transaction sections you need_—_no scrolling required. Note: Subsections under “Details” appear only if they have been set up in the application._
