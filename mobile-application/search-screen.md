The **Search Screen** in the iviva.DX mobile app makes it easy to find and filter transactions fast—right within an app.

### Search Modes

You can search in two ways:

* **Basic Search** – Type keywords or transaction IDs straight into the search bar
* **IQL (iviva Query Language)** – Use advanced filter expressions to get more precise results

### Filter Icon

At the top, you will see a **filter icon**. Tap it to open:

* A **dropdown** where you can pick from existing filter configurations (_like Default_)
* An indicator showing if the filter configuration is **Public** or **Private**
* A **three-dot menu** for defining and managing filter rules

👉 _Tap the **three-dot menu** to open the **Filter Settings** screen, where you can:_

* _Add or remove filter fields_ (_e.g., Stage, Created By_)
* _Save your customised filter for future use_

### Creating a New Transaction

Tap the **➕ icon** in the top-right corner to **create a new transaction**—just like you do in the web application.

Each transaction in the results list shows:

* Its **Transaction ID**
* Summary details like status, who created it, and the timestamp
* A **color-coded label** that highlights its priority or workflow stage

_💡 Tip: Saved filters make it quicker to find what you need—especially when you are working with large datasets._
