The iviva.DX mobile app makes logging in easy and secure.

You have got two ways to log in:

1. **Manual Login**\
   Enter your Domain, User ID, and Passcode.
2. **QR Code Login**\
   Tap the QR code icon and scan the code shown under **Mobile Connect** in your web account.

You will find both your login credentials and QR code in the [**Mobile Connect**](../iviva.dx-platform/mobile-login-links.md) section of the iviva.DX web application.

Before you log in, the app might ask for a few basic permissions—like access to your location, camera, and media—so everything works as it should.

💡 _Tip: Need a fresh QR code? You can generate a new one anytime from the web portal._
