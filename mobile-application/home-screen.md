On the Home Screen of the iviva.DX mobile app, you will see all your configured applications laid out in a scrollable list.

Each application appears as a color-coded card. You can:

* Tap the **➕ icon** to create a new transaction directly from your mobile device.
* Tap a card to access:
  * **Dashboard** – Opens the application's dashboard.
  * **Search** – Opens the transaction listing screen.

The layout works great in both **portrait** and **landscape** modes.

If you have enabled **IAssist** (the voice assistant feature) in your settings, you will see a microphone icon at the bottom-right. This lets you interact with the app using voice commands.

💡 _Tip: Use the search bar at the top to quickly find the app you need._
