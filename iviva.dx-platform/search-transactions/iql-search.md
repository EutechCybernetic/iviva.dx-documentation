# IQL Search

IQL is a powerful and flexible query language designed to help users easily retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data from various sources in a structured way. It combines the simplicity of traditional query languages like SQL with advanced features, offering intelligent capabilities that enhance query efficiency and deliver deeper data insights.

With IQL, users can define sophisticated filters and conditions to narrow down results. It supports pattern matching, range searches, and custom expressions, making data retrieval more precise and effective.



### How to Use IQL

To use **IQL** (Intelligent Query Language), follow this format:

* On the left, specify a **Search Index** (e.g., Coordinator, Priority, Created).
* In the middle, choose an **Operator** (e.g., =, !=, Like, In).
* On the right, enter a **Value** or use a **Keyword** (e.g., "Eutech", CurrentUser, CurrentMember, StartOfMonth).

Conditions can also be combined using **AND** or **OR** operators, allowing you to build more complex queries.
