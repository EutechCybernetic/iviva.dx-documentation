# Detail View in Search Page

When a transaction record (Component 1) is clicked, a side panel appears displaying a summary view of the transaction. Clicking the **Transaction ID** in the side panel (Component 2) redirects the user to the [full detail page](../transaction-view/) of that specific transaction.
