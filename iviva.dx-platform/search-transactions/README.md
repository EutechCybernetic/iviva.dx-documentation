# Search Transactions

The **Search Transactions** feature allows users to quickly search and filter a list of transactions based on specific criteria. This functionality is ideal for quickly finding specific transactions in a large set, enabling users to pinpoint relevant records with ease.

Users can perform searches using a variety of filters, such as filter by created user , filter by stage etc.
