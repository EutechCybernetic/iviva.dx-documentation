# Custom Filters

The **Custom Filter** page allows users to create and manage personalized filters for the search page within a DX application in the iviva DX system. Users can define filters using system keywords or fields that have been configured for filtering. This functionality provides more precise control over search results, making it easier to quickly locate relevant transactions or records. Filters created here can also be saved for future use, streamlining repetitive tasks and improving productivity across the platform.



### How to Apply a Custom Filter



The image below shows the search page before a custom filter is applied. To begin, click '**More**'.

Select the desired **field** to apply the filter, choose an **operator** (e.g., Equals, Contains, Greater Than), enter the **field value**, and then click '**Done**' to apply the custom filter.

You can save a custom filter by clicking **Save**, which opens a popup (see the image below). Here, you can define the filter name and set additional options such as **Is Public** or **Mark as Default**, making it easy to reuse the filter in future searches.
