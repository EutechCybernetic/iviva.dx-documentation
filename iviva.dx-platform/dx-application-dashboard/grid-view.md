# Grid View

The Grid View displays applications as individual cards arranged in a grid layout. This format provides a visual and organised way to browse available apps, showing key options such as “Dashboard” and “Search” on each card, along with a quick-create (+) button for new transactions. It enables users to quickly identify and access the functionality of each app at a glance.
