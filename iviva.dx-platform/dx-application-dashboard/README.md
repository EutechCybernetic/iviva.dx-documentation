# DX Application Dashboard

### Dashboard Overview

The DX Application Dashboard serves as a central hub where users can access all available business applications. It provides flexible viewing options—Grid View and List View—to suit different preferences for navigating and launching apps. Users can quickly search for applications, create new transactions, and access app-specific dashboards or search pages, all from a single, organised interface designed to enhance usability and streamline workflow navigation.
