# Settings

The **Settings** page allows users to personalise their application's navigation by adding sidebar menu entries. This feature enables administrators, or users with the appropriate access rights, to create additional menu items that link to either external URLs or internal sections within the application. Sidebar menu items can also be customised with icons, offering flexibility in both design and link behaviour (e.g., opening in a new tab or window).

**Component 1:** The **Search Bar** allows users to filter and locate custom links that have been added to the DX Sidebar. This helps in managing a large number of sidebar entries efficiently.

**Component 2:** The **Create Button** enables users to add a new custom link to the DX Sidebar. Clicking it opens a form where the user can specify the link name and URL.

**Component 3:** The **Edit Icon** allows users to modify the name or URL of an existing custom link. _(Part of the custom link card)_

**Component 4:** The **Delete Icon** enables users to remove the selected custom link from the sidebar configuration. _(Part of the custom link card)_
