# Create a Transaction

This is where the initial form of the selected application is displayed. Users can enter the required details and submit the form to create a new transaction specific to that application.

* **Component 1 :** The **Submit** button is used to finalize and submit the form, thereby creating a new transaction.
* **Component 2 :** The **Cancel** button allows you to exit the form without saving or submitting any entered information.
* **Component 3 :** The **Share** button enables anonymous access to the form. When clicked, it generates a shareable link and a QR code (as shown in the image below) that anyone can use to access the form without logging in. This button appears only if anonymous sharing has been enabled in the initial form’s configuration.
