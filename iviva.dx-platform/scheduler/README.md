# Scheduler

The **Scheduler** is a powerful tool designed to help you stay organized and ensure that important tasks are executed on time.

It allows you to plan, organize, and automate tasks or events within the application. It enables users to set specific dates and times for tasks, ensuring that activities are completed on time. \
With the Scheduler, you can efficiently manage deadlines, reminders, and recurring tasks to improve productivity and keep all activities on track.
