# Save Checklist

This section explains how to save the progress of a checklist without completing it. To begin, click **View** **Tasks** to open the popup containing the **Save** icon (as shown below). The **Save** icon allows users to store field values or task updates while keeping tasks marked as **incomplete**. \
This feature is especially useful when work is still in progress, ensuring that no information is lost and allowing users to return later to continue or complete the checklist at their convenience.

* **Component 1 :** This is the **Save** icon, which allows you to save the current status or field values of tasks without marking them as complete. It is useful when you want to preserve your progress but are not yet ready to finalise the task.
