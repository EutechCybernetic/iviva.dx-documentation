# Add Checklist

This page guides users through the steps required to add a checklist to a transaction. It includes several components that help select a checklist, associate relevant service items, and finalise the setup. The process is divided into clear steps, showing how to configure checklists, add or remove service items, and link the checklist to the transaction. \
Depending on the configuration, users can either select multiple predefined service items or enter them manually.

### Step 1&#x20;

* **Component 1 :** Clicking on **Add Checklist** opens a popup where users can add a checklist. Although it does not appear as a traditional button, it is clickable and functions as an action trigger.

### Step 2&#x20;

* **Component 1** : Select the desired **Checklist** to associate with this transaction. The tasks within the selected checklist will then be tracked and completed as part of this transaction.
* **Component 2** : The **Select Service Items** option, when enabled, allows you to choose multiple predefined items from the system—such as assets, locations, organisations, members, branch offices, or cost centers. When disabled, it switches to a single text input field where you can manually enter a service item by name. \
  [**Note**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]: In this mode, only one item can be specified.
* **Component 3** : The **Add New** option appears only when **Select Service Items** is enabled. Since multiple items can be selected in this mode, this option allows users to add additional service items. When **Select Service Items** is disabled, only a single text box is shown for manual entry, and the **Add New** option does not appear (See the image below).
* **Component 4**: After configuring the checklist and service items, click **Add** to attach the entire checklist to the current transaction, finalising the setup.

* **Component 1** : Select the type of service item you want to add, such as **Asset**, **Location**, **Organization**, **Branch Office**, **Cost Center**, etc.
* **Component 2** : After choosing the type, select the specific Service Item from the available list relevant to the chosen type.
* **Component 3** : Once the desired Service Item is selected, click **Add** to include it in the list of service items associated with the checklist.

#### Remove an Item After It Has Been Added
