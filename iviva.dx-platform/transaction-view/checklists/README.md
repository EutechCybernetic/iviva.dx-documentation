# Checklists

The **Checklist** provides a simple and organized way to track tasks and ensure nothing is overlooked. Whether managing a project, completing a series of steps, or organizing your day, you can mark each item as completed. This feature helps you stay focused, prioritize important tasks, and monitor your progress. With its easy-to-follow structure, the checklist ensures that all required actions are accounted for and completed on time.
