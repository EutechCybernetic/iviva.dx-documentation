# Task Complete

This popup appears when you click on **View Tasks** for a specific checklist. It allows you to complete individual tasks within the checklist. You can mark tasks as **complete** or **incomplete** by clicking the **tick** **icon**. If enabled, you can also add **comments** and attach **files** (such as images or documents) to each task. This interface provides all the necessary tools to review, update, and finalise tasks effectively.

* **Component 1 :** \
  Clicking the **tick icon** toggles the completion status of a task. If the task is incomplete, clicking the icon marks it as completed, indicated by a **green tick**. Once completed, the task's field value becomes **read-only**. If the task is already marked as completed and the tick icon is clicked again, it will be marked as **incomplete**, allowing the field value to be edited. For **mandatory tasks**, a field value must be entered before the task can be marked as completed.
* **Component 2 :** \
  Displays the **task duration** and the **assigned duration** for the task, allowing users to track and compare the expected time with the actual time spent.
* **Component 3 :** \
  Allows **attachments** such as images or documents, to be added to a task, providing supporting details related to the item being serviced or inspected.
* **Component 4 :** \
  Allows **comments** to be added to the task for additional information, clarifications, or follow-up actions not originally included in the task description.
