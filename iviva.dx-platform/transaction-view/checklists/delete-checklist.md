# Delete Checklist

This page explains how to delete a checklist from a transaction. Each checklist listed includes a **bin icon** that allows users to initiate deletion process. Clicking the bin icon opens a **confirmation popup** warning that deleted checklists cannot be restored. Users must explicitly confirm the deletion by clicking **Delete**, or cancel the action by selecting **No**. \
This safeguard ensures that checklists are removed only when intended, helping prevent accidental data loss.

* **Component 1:** Clicking the **bin icon** next to a checklist opens a **confirmation popup** warning that deleted checklists cannot be restored. If you confirm by clicking **Delete**, the checklist will be permanently removed from the transaction. Clicking **No** cancels the action.
