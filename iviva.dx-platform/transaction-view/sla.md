# SLA

A **Service Level Agreement** (SLA) defines the agreed-upon standards and expectations between service providers and clients. It outlines key metrics such as **response times**, **resolution times**, **service** **availability**, and **performance benchmarks**, ensuring clarity on both parties’ commitments. \
With an SLA in place, both the provider and client can monitor service delivery against these defined criteria, fostering accountability and improving overall service quality.

&#x20;This helps ensure that expectations remain aligned, potential issues are addressed promptly, and high-quality service is consistently maintained throughout the engagement.
