# Schedule

The **Schedule** section provides detailed timing for your task or event. It includes the **Target Start Date and Time**, which marks when the task is planned to begin, and the **Target End Date and Time**, indicates when it is expected to finish.&#x20;

The **Recurrence Pattern** shows how often the task repeats (e.g., weekly, monthly, etc.), and the **Sequence** indicates the order of occurrences (e.g., first, second, etc.).&#x20;

The **Scheduled Start and End Date & Time** reflect the actual scheduled dates and times for each occurrence, helping you stay on track with your planned timeline.
