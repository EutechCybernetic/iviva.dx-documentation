# Details

The **Details** tab displays all the submitted information for a transaction up to its current stage. This section provides a comprehensive view of the transaction's data, allowing users to review all captured fields.

The layout of the **Details** tab can be customized through application configuration. As shown in the image below, details can be grouped into subsections such as Related Members, Problem, Issue Location, Asset, Priority, and CWO. These subsections are fully configurable to meet different business requirements.

At the bottom of the **Details** tab, an **Update** button may appear, allowing users to save any changes made to the fields. However, this button is only visible if the Update action is not already enabled in the Transition Action Bar (as described in the Detail View Header with Transition Action Bar page).

* **Section 1 :** The sidebar appears when the **Details** tab is configured with subsections. Each item in the sidebar (e.g., Problem, Asset, Priority) acts as a navigation link, allowing users to quickly scroll to the corresponding section within the page. If no subsections are configured, the **Details** tab displays all transaction information in a single continuous view without segmented navigation.
* **Section 2 :** Located at the bottom of the **Details** tab, this button allows users to save changes made to the transaction’s fields. It appears only if the update option is not already configured in the Transition Action Bar.
