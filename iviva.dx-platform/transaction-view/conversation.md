# Conversation

Activating the **Conversation** facility enhances communication by enabling real-time discussions and allowing users to attach various types of files, including images, videos, and documents. \
This feature ensures that team members can share essential resources, provide visual context, and collaborate more effectively. With support for attachments, you can streamline communication, making it easier to discuss tasks, share feedback, and stay aligned with all relevant materials accessible in one centralised space.
