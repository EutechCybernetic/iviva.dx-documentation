# Default Header

The **Detail View Header** displays essential information and actions related to a transaction. By default, it includes the **Transaction Record ID**, the **Current Stage Indicator** (with transition options), and the **View Report** and **View Workflow** icons.&#x20;

Additional features such as the **Share Link** for anonymous access and the **QR Code** icon appear only if they are enabled in the application configuration. This header layout can be customized to meet the specific needs of the application.

The image below shows the **Detail View Header** with all available options configured and visible, except the **Transition Bar**, which will be shown on the next page.
