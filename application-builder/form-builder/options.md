# Options

The **Options** tab controls how selectable values are shown and handled in the respective field. You can customise the format, sorting, and how flexible the input is—whether you are using dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, or tile-based selection components.

**Component 1 → Enable Search for Options**\
Turn the **Enable Search for Options** on to allow users search through the list using a text box. It is especially handy when there are many items in the list, making selection faster and more efficient.

**Component 2 → Enable Sort Options to Alphabetical Order**\
Select the **Enable Sort Options to Alphabetical Order** option to automatically sort field options from A to Z. It helps users scan the list more easily and keeps things consistent.

**Component 3 → View Mode**\
Use the **View Mode** dropdown to choose how options are shown to user. You can select any from the following:

* **List View** – Shows options in a vertical list with checkboxes
* **Tile View** – Shows each option as separate, clickable tile

**Component 4 → Field Options**\
This is where you set up the options users can pick from. You can type in multiple options manually—like Option One, Option Two—and add more anytime using the **+ Add an Option** link.
