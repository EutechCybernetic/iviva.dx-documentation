# Table Options

Use the **Table Options** tab to configure how the advanced table field behaves—adjust column setup, data types, alignment, and user permissions for interacting with the table.

**Component 1 → Column Header Name**\
Sets the name of the column as it appears in the table. Each column should have a unique, descriptive title (e.g., _Column One_).

**Component 2 → Column Data Type**\
**Column Data Type** defines the type of data the column will hold. Supported types include Text, Number, Phone, Email, Date, Checkbox, and more. This helps ensure consistency and proper validation.

**Component 3 → Column Alignment**\
Lets you align column content to the left, center, or right—useful for improving readability, especially in numeric or status fields.

**Component 4 → Column Width**\
Specifies the column’s width in pixels. For example, entering “25” sets the column to use 25% of the table’s width.

**Component 5 → Allow to Add Row**\
When the 'Allow to Add Row' toggle is enabled, users can add new rows to the table while filling out the form. This is ideal for capturing variable-length data without setting a fixed limit.

**Component 6 → Allow to Remove Row**\
Enable the 'Allow to Remove Row' toggle to let users delete rows from the table. This is useful for correcting mistakes or updating entries on the fly.

Each column includes an optional **Make This Column Read-only** checkbox. When selected, it prevents users from editing that column while keeping the rest of the table editable.
