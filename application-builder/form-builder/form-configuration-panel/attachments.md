# Attachments

The Attachments tab lets you set up how users can upload and manage files—like images, videos, or other media—through the Attachment field. You can control what types of files are allowed and customise the upload options to suit different workflows or user needs.

**Component 1 → Show Pickers**\
This toggle determines whether file picker options appear on the form. When enabled, users can view and use upload buttons like Camera and Image directly within the form.

**Component 2 → Enabled Selectors**\
Use the **Enabled Selectors** dropdown to choose which upload sources are allowed. Available selectors include:

* **CAMERA** – Take a photo using the device’s camera
* **VIDEO** – Upload or record a video
* **IMAGE** – Pick images from the gallery or file browser
* **OTHER** – Upload any other file type (not image or video)

If no options are selected, all pickers are enabled by default—providing full flexibility unless a specific set is required.
