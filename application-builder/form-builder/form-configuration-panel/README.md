# Form Configuration Panel

The **Form Configuration Panel** lets you configure the properties and behaviour of an individual field you add in your form. After selecting a field from the Field Selector, drag it into the layout. Then click the field's edit icon to open its settings. You can tweak each field’s function, look, and validation to fit your needs.

Every field includes **eight standard configuration tabs**:

* **General**
* **Defaults**
* **Visibility**
* **Editability**
* **Events**
* **Styles**

Some fields also include **field-specific configuration tabs** such as:

* **Search Options**
* **Filter**
* **Layouts**
* **Object Reference**
* **Options**
* **Date Time**
* **Attachments**
* **Table Options**
* **Map**
* **Transactions**
* **Others**

These tabs let form designers apply rules and customisations to match their workflow. Every tab is covered individually in the following pages.
