# General

The **General** tab covers the basics—how the field is named, shown, and used in a form. It controls what users see, whether the field is required or editable, and how it looks. It is available for all field types and is usually the first place to start when customising a field.

#### **Component 1 → Search Index**

* A unique identifier the platform uses to reference this field internally (e.g., **DXI\_SID\_17490153321291D4YOSAFHAL**). This value can be changed—as long as the new one does not conflict with other fields.

#### **Component 2 → Label**&#x20;

* Sets the field's display name—like “User”—as it appears on the form. End users see this next to the input when filling out the form.

#### **Component 3 → Display Name**

* An optional, user-friendly name that replaces the Label on the form. Handy when the Label uses an internal code—like showing “Requester” instead of “User.” If left blank, the Label is shown.

#### **Component 4 → Field Info**

* Adds helper text or instructions near the field—like a tooltip. Use it to guide users on what to enter (e.g. Select the person responsible for this request).

#### **Component 5 → Make This Field Mandatory**

* When the 'Make This Field Mandatory' is turned on, users must fill in the field before they can save or submit the form. An asterisk (\*) appears next to the label, and blocks submission until a valid value is entered.

#### **Component 6 → Make This Field Hidden**

* When the 'Make This Field Hidden' is turned on, it completely hides the field from the form UI. Even though the field is hidden from view, the system or automated workflows can still fill in its data. It is useful for system-managed metadata that users don’t need to see.

#### **Component 7 → Make This Field Read-only**

* Displays the field but locks its value so users cannot change it. Great for auto-filled fields like _Created Date or Created By._

#### **Component 8 → Hide Field Label**

* Hides the label text but keeps the input visible. Useful for compact layouts or when the field’s purpose is clear from context—like an icon-based control.
