In the Layouts tab, you will find these options:

1. **Enable Layout Picker** – Turn on the **Enable Layout Picker** toggle to activate an interface that lets users choose which layout or map to display for the selected object group.
2. **Enable Marker Popup** – Turn on the **Enable Marker Popup** toggle to display clickable markers in the layout view. Each marker opens a popup  with key details about the associated object group when clicked.
3. **Enable Interactive Zoom** – Turn on the **Enable Interactive Zoom** toggle to lets users zoom and pan directly within the layout canvas—helpful for exploring specific areas or groups.
4. **Location Layout Category** – Connects the respective field to a predefined layout category, ensuring only relevant layout sets appear in the picker.
5. **Default Location for Layout** – Lets you pick which location or map loads by default when this field’s layout is displayed—so users immediately see the most common or critical view without extra clicks.
