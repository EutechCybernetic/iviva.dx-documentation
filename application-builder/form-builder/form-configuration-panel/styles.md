# Styles

Use the **Styles** section to style the selected field however you like using CSS. You can change how it looks on the form—fonts, colours, spacing, whatever you need—to match your design.

**Component 1 →  Additional Styles (CSS):**

The Additional Styles (CSS) section is a free-form text area where you can add CSS to customise how the field looks in the browser.

* Use it to enter CSS rules to override or extend the default styling of the field on the web interface.&#x20;
* Any valid changes only affect this field and only appear when users view or interact with the form online.
* For example, you can tweak things like background colour, spacing, font weight, or anything else you want to style.

It is a handy way to keep your fields consistent while still tailoring them for different use cases.
