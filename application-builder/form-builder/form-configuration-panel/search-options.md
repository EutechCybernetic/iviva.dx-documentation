# Search Options

The **Search Options** tab controls how the respective field can be used in search queries and filters throughout the application.

**Component 1 → Include Field into Like Search**\
Turn the **Include Field in Like Search** toggle on to include the field’s values in wildcard searches. So if someone types a broad query like “John” into the global search bar, any record where this field contains “John” will show up in the results.

**Component 2 →Enable Field as a Filter**\
Turning on  the '**Enable Field as a Filter'** toggle makes the field appear in the search panel under 'Filters'. Users can then narrow down transaction lists by choosing specific values—for example, filtering work requests where “Assigned To” matches a particular user.
