# Defaults

#### **Defaults Tab**

The **Defaults** tab allows you to set predefined values for a field that automatically populate when the form is first loaded. This helps reduce manual input, guide user responses, and pre-fill commonly used data. Default values improve consistency and speed up the form-filling process, especially in high-volume or repetitive entry scenarios.

**Component 1 → Default Value**

The Default Value sets the initial value that appears in the field when a new form is opened. The value is auto-filled but can be changed by the user before submitting the form. It helps speed up data entry by preselecting common or recommended inputs.
