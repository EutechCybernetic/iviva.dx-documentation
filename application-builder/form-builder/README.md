# 🛠️ Form Builder

🧩 **Form Builder Overview**

The **Form Builder** is a visual workspace for building forms and how they work. You can add, preview, and manage fields across custom apps. The layout has two main sections—each playing a specific role in the form design process.

#### 🧷 Component 1 → Form Preview Panel

This panel shows a live view of the form layout—just as end users will see it. Each field appears as a card, giving designers a clear picture of how inputs are structured and arranged in the form.

#### ⚙️ Component 2 → Form Configuration Panel

This section gives you full control over the form’s structure and logic. It includes two key sections:

* **Selected Fields**: Shows all active fields in the form, along with their technical labels and types
* **Field Selector Pallet:** Lists available system fields (e.g. _User_, _Location_, _Asset_, _Department_).&#x20;

You can drag fields from selector into the layout, reorder them, and configure each one. Click the edit icon on any field card to adjust its properties using the tabs like—**General**, **Visibility**, **Editability**, and **Events.**

This  configuration panel ensures the form collects the right data in the right format for the intended workflow. It controls both the structure and behaviour of the form, helping users tailor data collection to match their exact needs.
