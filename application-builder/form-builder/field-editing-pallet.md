# Field Editing Pallet

The Field Editing Pallet displays all the fields you have added to the form. Each field appears as a draggable card, which reflects its settings and position in the form.

Fields in this panel can be easily reordered using drag-and-drop functionality, so you can adjust the form’s layout without re-adding anything. Each card has an edit icon, which opens the full configuration panel for that field.&#x20;

This setup gives you a central, flexible way to fine-tune how each field looks and behaves, making the form-building process smoother and more efficient.
