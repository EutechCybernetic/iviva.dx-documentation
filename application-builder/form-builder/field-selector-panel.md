# Field Selector Panel

The **Field Selector Panel** is your field library—where you find all the fields you can add to a form. The panel is located on the right side of the form builder and offers two main tabs to support both reuse and customisation.

🗂️ **Component 1 → Existing Tab**\
The **Existing** tab shows fields that have already been used in the same application. This includes both system-defined and custom-created fields. These may have appeared in other forms or transitions—such as common fields like _Assignee, Priority, or Location._ Dragging fields from here ensures consistency across forms and saves time, since they are already configured and ready to reuse.

🆕 **Component 2 → New Tab**\
The **New** tab lets you create fields from scratch. It offers a wide range of field types, including:

*  Basic input controls – single-line and multi-line text
* Selectors – dropdowns, toggles, and check boxes
* Date and time pickers
* Advanced options – object references, file uploaders, and external web link connectors

You can customise these fields and drag them directly into the form canvas for immediate use.
