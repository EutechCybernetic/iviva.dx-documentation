# Object Reference

The **Object Reference** tab controls how certain field connects to and interacts with other objects in the system such as assets, locations, or users. It determines how users find, select, and optionally create new related records in the form.

1. **Object Selector Type** – Pick how users choose an object category—either from a dropdown or by selecting icon buttons.
2. **Item Selector Type** – Once an object category is chosen, the **Item Selector Type** decides how users pick the actual object—either from a dropdown or via clickable cards.
3. **Add On Selection** – When enabled, users see an “Add New” button right after selecting an existing object, letting them immediately create and link a new object if needed.
4. **Keep Add Section Open** – If the **Keep Add Section Open** is turned on, the “Add New” form stays open after each new object is added—so users can keep adding more objects without having to reopen the panel every time.
5. **Supported Object Types** – This field lists all the object categories the field can reference, separated by commas. Only these types will show up in the selector.
