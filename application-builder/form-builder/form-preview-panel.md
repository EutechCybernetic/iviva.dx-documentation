# Form Preview Panel

The **Form Preview Panel** shows a live visual layout of the form as you build it. It gives a clear view of how the form will look to end users during actual use. Each configured field appears as its own card, making it easy to spot and understand the flow. This panel helps you check field placement, order, and overall design before finalising the setup.
