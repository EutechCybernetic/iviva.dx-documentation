# Filters

The **Filters** tab lets you to restrict and refine the list of selectable values shown in dropdown or lookup fields. This is especially useful when a field pulls data from large datasets—such as users, assets, or locations—and you want to limit what users see based on predefined rules or context-sensitive conditions.

**Enable Search for Options:** Turn on the **Enable Search for Options** toggle to allows users to search through the list of filtered results using a search box. It is ideal when working with long or complex datasets.

The Filters tab supports two main types of filters:

* **Static Filters**

Static Filters are fixed filter conditions you set at the design phase. You set a fixed list of values or criteria that always apply whenever someone uses the form. For example, you might choose to show users from a certain department or limit locations to a specific region.

* **Dynamic Filters**

\
Dynamic Filters adjust in real-time based on another field’s value in the form. Just link the selected field to a "parent" field, and the available options will dynamically update to reflect the parent’s current value.&#x20;

Each filter type plays a crucial role in making the form more intelligent and context-aware, helping end users select relevant values quickly and accurately.
