# Date-Time

The Date-Time tab lets you fine-tune how users pick dates and times in the selected field. You can choose whether users need to select a full timestamp (date and time) or just a calendar date.

The Date-Time tab offers the following settings.

**Component 1 → Close Picker on Selection**\
Enable the **Close Picker on Selection** toggle to make the calendar or time picker close automatically after a user selects a date or time. When enabled, it speeds things up but might limit multi-step edits.

**Component 2 → Show Time Input**\
Turn on the **Show Time Input** toggle to show the time field next to the calendar. If turned off, users can only pick a date—perfect for date-only tasks like birthdays or expiry dates.
