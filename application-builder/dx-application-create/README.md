The **DX App Create** is a guided setup that helps users **build their own applications from start to finish.** Whether you're starting from a **blank canvas** or choosing a **ready-made template**, this flow makes it easy to configure everything your app needs.&#x20;

You begin by entering key information such as the **app name, prefix, theme,** and **icon** to give your app its identity. You can also choose from a list of **sample templates** that come with built-in workflows, saving time and effort if your use case matches one of the common scenarios.

As you progress through each step, you’ll define the app’s structure using tools including **form builders, stage definitions, workflow transitions, role-based access controls, SLA settings,** and **automated workflows.** Each section is designed to let you **tailor the app** to match your business logic and user responsibilities. Once completed, your app will be fully equipped with the rules, roles, and flows needed to operate smoothly in real-world scenarios.

This entire process is intuitive and flexible, allowing both **technical** and **non-technical user**s to build powerful apps without **deep coding knowledge.**
