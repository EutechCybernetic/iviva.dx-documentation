# User Roles

The User Roles section allows you to define various roles that users are assigned within the application. These roles help determine access levels, responsibilities, and workflow permissions, ensuring that each user interacts with the application according to their designated function.

**Component 1 - Search**\
The search field allows you to quickly find a user role by typing either its full name or part of its name. This is helpful when dealing with a long list of roles.

**Component 2 - Add New Role**\
Clicking the plus (+) icon opens the panel for creating a new user role. This allows you to define custom roles tailored to your organization’s structure.

**1 → User Role Name**\
Enter the name of the new role you want to define _(e.g., Supervisor, Analyst)._

**2 → User Role Description**\
Provide a brief description that explains the responsibilities or scope of the role.

**Component 3 - Role List**\
Displays the roles currently defined in the system, such as Admin, Manager, Operator, and Requester.&#x20;

**Component 4** - **Role Name**\
Shows the name of the specific user role. This name defines the role label within the app and identifies the responsibilities associated with it.

**Component 5 - Edit Role**\
Click the edit icon to open the role editor, where you can modify the role name or description.

**Component 6 - Delete Role**\
Click the trash icon to remove a role from the application. Use this with caution, as removing roles may affect existing user assignments.

After configuring user roles, you reach the final step in the app creation process. Once all roles are defined and configured, click the **Create** button at the bottom to complete the DX App creation journey.
