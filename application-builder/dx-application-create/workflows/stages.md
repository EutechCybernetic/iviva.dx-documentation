# Stages

The Stages section allows you to define the key milestones or steps a task or request goes through in your workflow. Each stage marks a specific point in the process, helping users see the current status and understand the next actions.

Once you configure your initial form, the Stages page becomes the next critical step in setting up how your workflow operates.

**Component 1 - Stage Card**

**Component 2 - Stage Name**\
Displays the name of the stage. For example, 'Open,' 'In-Progress,' or 'Closed.' This helps users identify the current progress of a transaction.

**Component 3 - Status**\
Indicates whether the stage is currently **Active** or **Inactive**. Inactive stages will not be used unless manually reactivated.

**Component 4 - Initial Stage Label**\
This label marks the starting point of the workflow. Only one stage can be set as the **Initial Stage**, and all the transactions begin here.

**Component 5 - Edit Button**

Opens the stage editor, where you can rename the stage or change its status.

**Component 6 - Delete Button**\
Permanently removes a stage from the workflow. Useful for cleaning up unused or redundant stages.

**Component 7 - Search Bar**\
Helps you quickly find a specific stage by typing its name.

**Component 8 - Add New Stage**\
Clicking this button opens a form where you can create a new stage, give it a name, and set whether it should be active.

Each stage plays a vital role in defining how a task is handled and monitored from start to finish. Setting up clear and well-organised stages helps streamline workflows and provides visibility into task progress for all users involved.
