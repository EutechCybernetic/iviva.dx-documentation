# Workflow Details

The Workflow Details section is where you define how your application will handle tasks and processes. It provides a structured starting point to either create a new workflow or use an existing one as a template.

**Component 1 -** **Workflow Details**

Give your workflow a name and a short description. This lets you create and customise the workflow from scratch, giving you full control to design it exactly the way you need.

**Component  2 - Sample Workflow Template**

Choose from a variety of ready-made workflow templates. Each template comes with predefined stages and transitions, so you can get started quickly without building everything from scratch.

When you click on a sample workflow template, a pop-up panel appears where you can give your copied workflow a new name and description. This way, you can reuse proven workflows and adjust them to fit your needs—saving time while staying flexible.

Whether you want to create a workflow from the beginning or modify an existing one, this step makes it easy to start set up your application's process logic.
