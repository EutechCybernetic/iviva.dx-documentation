The Workflows section defines the path that tasks follow from beginning to end within your application. It allows you to map out each step of the process so tasks move in a clear, structured, and controlled manner, ensuring work is completed efficiently and nothing important is overlooked.

Workflows consist of several key components, including:

* Initial Form
* Initial Form Configuration
* Stages
* Transitions
* SLA Configuration

Each component plays a specific role in how a task is captured, processed, moved forward, and completed.

Together, these elements help streamline operations by providing structure, timing, and logic to your business processes, helping teams stay on track and respond quickly to changes.
