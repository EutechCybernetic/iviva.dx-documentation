**Review App Details** – The details panel shows the app’s metadata. Review these values carefully to ensure you are exporting the correct application.

Once you have reviewed the information, click the **Confirm** button at the bottom of the panel. This will generate the JSON file and download it to your computer.

Following these steps lets you safely export any DX App’s configuration for archiving or importing into another environment.
