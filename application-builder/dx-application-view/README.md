# DX Application View

The **DX Application View** is a centralised interface where users can manage and improve an application after it has been published. It provides access to all the key components set up during creation, along with advanced tools to maintain, customise, and extend the application’s functionality, including adding and managing access rights, viewing version history, and configuring application view.
