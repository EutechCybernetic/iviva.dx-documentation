# Translation

The **Translations** section lets administrators manage and customise the application’s language support. It allows them to provide multilingual content for various User Interface (UI elements), ensuring a localised and user-friendly experience for users worldwide. Each translation entry corresponds to a specific component or label that can be displayed in multiple languages.
