# Version History

The **Version History** section tracks every published revision of your application, reflecting changes made after initial transactions are created.

• A new version is created only when the application’s design (forms, workflows, configurations, etc.) is modified after at least one transaction exists.\
• If no transactions are created, saving changes updates the current version rather than creating a new one.

#### **Component 2 → Version Entries**

In the Version History section, you can see the current active version (_Online_), any unpublished changes (_Draft),_ and previously published versions (_Abandoned)._ It gives you a quick overview of the live release, in-progress edits, and past versions at a glance.

#### **Component 3 → Abandoned Version Detail**

Click on an abandoned version to view its full configurations and settings for a detailed review.

#### **Component 4 → Deactivate App Button**

Click the **Deactivate App** button to take the current active version offline. Once deactivated, users cannot access it until you reactivate it.
