# Transition Forms

The **Transition Forms** section allows users to manage and customise forms associated to specific workflow transitions. After creating the app, users can return to this section to edit existing transition forms or add new ones.

Transition forms appear when moving from one stage to another (e.g., 'Start Work' to 'In Progress' or 'In Progress' to 'Completed'). Each form captures data relevant to that specific step in the workflow.

In this section, users can:

* **Edit existing transition forms** to update fields.
* **Add new transition forms** using the '+' button at the top right.
* **Configure visibility and editability expressions** for each field, allowing dynamic behavior based on conditions (_e.g., show a field only if a certain value is selected_).

This flexibility ensures that each transition steps collect the exact information needed while adapting the form interface based on user input or prior values, improving both efficiency and overall user experience.
