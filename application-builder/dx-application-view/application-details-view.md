# Application Details View

The **App Details** View provides a centralised interface where users can view application details, view version information, and configure access rights.&#x20;

### Accessing the App Details Page

After completing the app creation process, you can find your app on the DX Composer Dashboard.

Clicking on the app card opens App details page. In the Details section, users can control who can access the app and how it is managed.

The App Details page consists of the following key sections:

* Details
* Initial Form
* Transition Forms
* Workflows
* Priorities
* User Roles
* Notification
* Configurations
* Translations
* Version History

**Component 1 → Access Rights Panel**\
Access Rights Panel displays the access rights assigned to the application. This panel shows which user groups are linked to which user roles.&#x20;

_💡 Tip: You need to assign at least one access right (a user group and a user role) before you can activate the application._

When adding access rights, Add Access Rights side panel opens.

**1 → User Group**\
Select the user group that should have access to the app (e.g., IT Support, HR Team).

**2 → User Role**\
Choose the user role to assign within the selected group (e.g., Admin, Requester, Operator). This determines the level of access users in that group will have.

**Component 2 → Activate App**\
The **Activate App** button becomes available **only after a version has been published.** You must grant at least one access right to a user role before activating the app. Activating the app makes it live and usable in the system.

**Component 3 → Publish this Version**\
Click the **Publish this Version** button to publish the current version of the app (e.g., from Draft to V1.0). Publishing locks in the current configuration and allows you to activate the application.
