The **SLA Configuration** section in the app view maintains the same structure and purpose as during creation. It allows users to view, edit, or add Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that define expected duration of transactions between workflow stages.

Each SLA includes timing rules based on start and end stages, optional resets for loop-backs, inclusion of non-working hours, and priority-based durations. Users can manage existing SLAs, define new ones, or adjust associated priority thresholds. This section lets you keep managing or updating your existing SLA settings—no new features have been added.
