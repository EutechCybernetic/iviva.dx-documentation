# Stages

The **Stages** section allows users to manage the key milestones (or workflow checkpoints) that a transaction passes through during its lifecycle. These stages represent each step in the business process, from initiation to completion. Within this section, users can add new stages, edit existing ones, reorder them, or remove any unnecessary stages to better reflect the workflow requirements.

**1 → Enable Happy Path**&#x20;

**Enable Happy Path** highlights the default or recommended transition for the current stage. This transition is visually emphasised with an icon to prompt user action and serves as the main expected flow through the application.

By using this section effectively, teams can ensure that workflows reflect real operational paths and streamline task movement between steps.
