# Transitions

The **Transitions** section allows users to view, edit, or add stage-to-stage movements that define how a workflow progresses. Each transition includes a label, starting stage, ending stage, and an optional form to be filled during the transition. The layout and functionality remain identical to the configuration done during app creation.

Users can still manage transition logic, associate or modify forms, and update transition details as needed. This keeps the workflow dynamic and adaptable after deployment, without adding new features beyond the original setup.
