# Workflow Details

The **Workflow Detail** section provides a centralised summary of key attributes for the selected workflow in your application. It is useful for managing or referencing workflow-level information such as **template ID, name**, and **description**.

**Section 1 - Workflow Details**

The Workflow Details section shows the details of a workflow from an already created application. You can view information such as Workflow ID, Workflow Name, and Workflow Description.

**Section 2 - Edit Workflow Details**

To edit workflow details, click the **pencil icon** available in the right corner of the blue bar.

You can edit the workflow details, such as the **Workflow Name** and **Workflow Description**, if needed. The **Workflow ID** remains unchanged, as it uniquely identifies the workflow.
