# Initial Form

The **Initial Form** allows users to edit and update the form structure of the application after it has been created. Unlike during the creation phase, this view provides extended functionality to refine form behaviour. Users can add new fields, rearrange existing ones, and make adjustments to keep the form aligned with evolving business needs.

A key feature of this view is the ability to configure **field-level visibility and editability** conditions. This means you can control when a field appears (**visibility**) based on specific rules or user inputs.

* You can control a field’s **editability** based on predefined logic.

The ability to set **conditional expressions** for each field allows forms to be dynamic and responsive, adapting to the context. These options aren’t available during the initial creation process and are specific to the **App View** phase.

This section lets users go beyond basic layout and data capture by adding **conditional behavior** directly in the form, creating a more intelligent and streamlined user experience.
