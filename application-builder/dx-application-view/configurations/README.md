The Configuration section allows administrators fine-tune application behaviour and interface settings, giving them greater control over how workflows are displayed and interacted with. This section has two main parts:

* **Search Configuration**: Customise the search interface by setting field filters and optional subtitles to improve data filtering and visibility.
* **View Configuration**: Control the visibility and behaviour of components in the transaction detail view, including checklists, schedulers, SLA rules, and conversation sections.

These configurations allow users to personalise how transactions are searched, displayed, and interacted with in the system. Detailed explanations for each part follow in the upcoming sections.
