# Search Configuration

The **Search Configuration** section allows users to customise how the transaction search interface appears and functions. It determines what data is prominently displayed in search results and which filtering options are available, making it easier for users to find and interpret transaction records efficiently.

**Component 1 → Enable Main Title**&#x20;

Select the **Enable Main Title** check box to control whether a primary identifier (such as a transaction ID or title) is displayed prominently in the search results. When enabled, it helps users quickly recognise each record easily.

**Component 2 → Subtitle Configuration Panel**&#x20;

The **Subtitle c**onfiguration panel allows users to choose specific fields to display as subtitles below the main title in each result. Subtitles provide additional context about a transaction, such as ID, Created Date, or other important attributes.

**Component 3 → Subtitle Field Selector**&#x20;

From the Subtitle field selector, users can pick fields (from dropdown) to be shown as subtitles. The selected fields appear under the main title in the search results, providing users with quick insights into key details of each record.

**Component 4 → System Field Filter Configuration**&#x20;

Use the **System Field Filter Configuration** to choose which system fields appear as filters in the search interface. Fields such as _CreatedBy, Stage, and TargetStartDate_ can be enabled or disabled. Enabled fields appear in the More Filters dropdown, helping users narrow down search results efficiently.

These settings directly impact the app’s search experience by controlling what users see and how they filter and find relevant transactions.
