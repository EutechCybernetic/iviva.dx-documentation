# Priorities

The **Priority** section enables users to configure various priority levels that define the urgency or importance of submitted tasks or requests. These priority tags help in differentiating how workflows and SLA timings should behave depending on how critical a particular item is. Each priority level is color-coded and can be marked as default to simplify classification during form submissions or automated processes.

**1 → Priority Name**\
The **Priority Name** field represents the priority level, such as High, Medium, or Low. It is a mandatory field and must be unique.

**2 → Priority Color**\
Users can select a color associated with the priority. This helps visually distinguish different priority types across the app.

**3 → Is Default**\
Choose the **Is Default** check box to mark the priority as the default option. The default priority will automatically be applied to all new entries unless manually changed. Also, this check box is optional.

**Component 2 → Priority Tag Display**\
Displays the configured priority levels in a color-coded format. A tag shows a ‘Default’ badge if it’s set as the system default.

**Component 3 → Edit Button**\
Used to open the edit panel where users can modify the priority’s name, color, or default status.

Setting up priority levels helps enforce appropriate urgency across tasks and enhances SLA-driven performance tracking.
