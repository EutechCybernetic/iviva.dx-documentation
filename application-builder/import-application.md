# Import Application

The Import Application section enables administrators to upload a JSON definition to bring an existing DX App into the platform. This makes it easy to move an app between environments (for example, from development to staging) or restore a backup of the app’s configuration.

Users can easily bring an existing DX App into the platform by uploading its previously exported JSON file. Click to select the file or drag and drop it into the import area to start the process.

Once a JSON file is chosen (via click or drag‐and‐drop), the system parses its contents and displays a detailed preview of the imported application’s metadata and components automatically.

After parsing, the **Edit Application Details** window appears next to a read-only preview pane, letting you review all the key information about the imported app.&#x20;

In the **Edit Application Details** window, modify the application details (_e.g., App Name, App Description, App Theme, App Prefix, or App Icon_) as needed.

Click **Update** to save your changes.

After updating, check the read-only preview to verify all imported settings and statistics are correct.

Once you have finished editing and verified that all imported details are correct, click **Upload** to complete the import process.
