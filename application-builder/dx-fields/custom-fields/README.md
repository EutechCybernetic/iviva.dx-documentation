In iviva DX, Custom Fields are the building blocks that let you shape forms to fit your business needs. These fields allow you to capture diverse information—not just limited to the standard system fields—giving you complete control over the exact data type and format you need.

Each custom field is built for a specific type of input (_e.g., text, numbers, dates, images, checkboxes, ratings, or even maps_). Just choose the ones you need and configure them to build forms that are both useful and engaging, no matter the workflow or use case.

Custom fields help you build user-friendly forms tailored to your goals, making it easier to collect the right information in the right way. Whether it’s a simple feedback form or a complex data capture form, custom fields give you the flexibility to design forms that work exactly how you need them to.
