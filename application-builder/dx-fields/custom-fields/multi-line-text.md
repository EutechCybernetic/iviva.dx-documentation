# 🔠Multi Line Text

The **Multi Line Text** field is a custom input designed for longer text entries in a form. Unlike the Single Line Text field, it gives you a bigger space where you can write across multiple lines—perfect for detailed responses, comments, or descriptions. You can enter up to 8000 characters.
