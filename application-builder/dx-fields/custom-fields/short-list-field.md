# 📑Short List Field

The **Short List** field lets users quickly select one or more items from a dynamic list they build directly within the form. It is useful when input choices are not predefined and need to be added as users interact with the form. Each item is treated as a separate entry, and users can edit or remove items as needed. The maximum length per item is 255 characters.
