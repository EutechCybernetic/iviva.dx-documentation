# 🔛Toggle Switch

The **Toggle Switch** field is a user-friendly input element that allows users to switch between two states—like ON/OFF, Enabled/Disabled, or True/False conditions. Compared to a regular checkbox, a toggle switch offers a cleaner, more intuitive look—perfect for actions where the on/off state matters or you want things to be visually clear.
