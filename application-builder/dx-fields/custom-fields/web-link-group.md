# 🌐Web Link Group

The **Web Link Group** field allows users to add and manage multiple external links in a structured format.  Each entry includes a **Title** and a **URL**, with a maximum length of 2048 characters each. It is great for organising references, manuals, resources, or other supporting materials related to the form.
