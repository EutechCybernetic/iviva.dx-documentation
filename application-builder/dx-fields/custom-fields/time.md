# 🕒 Time

The **Time** field is a focused input for capturing specific time values. It’s especially useful for things like scheduling appointments, setting deadlines, or defining shift times. The field usually shows a scrollable dropdown with time slots in fixed intervals, making selection quick and mistake-free. If manual entry is enabled, users can also type in a custom time using the hh:mm AM/PM format. The design keeps things clean and user-friendly, helping prevent invalid or misformatted entries.
