# 🧭 Geo Map

The Geo Map field allows users to mark and save geographical locations using coordinates—great for capturing job sites, issue spots, or asset positions during field work. The field supports coordinate validation—longitude (x) must be between -180 and 180, and latitude (y) must be between -90 and 90.
