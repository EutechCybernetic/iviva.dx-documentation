# 🖋️Object Groups



Easily group multiple related objects—like assets, locations, departments, or teams using the **Object Groups** field. This is mainly useful in property and facility management, where you want to apply actions, workflows, and tracking across an entire set instead of handling each item separately.

The Object Groups field make bulk operations easy and ensures structured data input by allowing users to set up, view, and interact with multiple related objects through a single interface.

🗺️ **Link with Spatial Layouts**\
This field type offers spatial visualisation enhancements:

* **Tab:** Layouts
* **Purpose:** Allows you to link object groups to spatial layouts such as floor plans or maps
* **Use Case:** Great for showing object positions in context, whether it’s a building, equipment, or a zone.
* **Functionality:** Enables interactive zooming, marker popups, and setting a default layout for better user orientation

🏷️ **Object Selection Behavior**\
This field type offers flexible object-picking configurations:

* **Tab:** Object Reference
* **Purpose:** Controls how users pick objects to include in a group
* **Use Case:** Perfect for forms that need to reference assets, members, or other system entities
* **Functionality:** Defines selector style (dropdown or icons), allows to choose a display mode (cards or list), enables “Add New” for quick object creation, and limits what type of objects can be picked
