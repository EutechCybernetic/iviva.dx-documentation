# 📁 Project

Use the **Project** field to select a specific project that is already set up in the system. This is well-suited in property and facility management, where work orders, tasks, or assets are often belong to larger projects such as renovations, maintenance schedules, or infrastructure upgrades.

When you click on the Project field, you will see a dropdown with all the available projects (e.g., _Project Horizon_, _Project Apex_). The project names come directly from the master project list stored in the system, keeping everything consistent and helping prevent manual entry mistakes.

The Project field makes sure each form submission or task is tied to its parent project, which makes tracking, reporting, and accountability much easier.
