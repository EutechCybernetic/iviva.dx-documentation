# System Fields

#### What are System Fields? 🧐

**System Fields** are built-in fields connected directly to key data objects in the iviva DX system—like assets, locations, users, and projects.

They are ready to use out of the box, so you can quickly reference standardised information without manual setup or configuration.🚀

System Fields let you:

* 🎯 Choose from trusted system-wide data entities
* 🔗 Automatically link to detailed object views
* 📱 Scan QR codes for quick identification (in many cases)
* 🔍 Filter and search  data easily



#### 🎯 Static Filters

**What it is:** Predefined filter values set by the user or admin\
**Use case:** Limits choices to a fixed, known subset—independent of other field inputs\
**Note:** Ideal for consistent filtering that does not rely on form inputs

***

#### 🔄 Dynamic Filters

**What it is:** Filters that update dynamically based on selections in other fields within the same form\
**Fallback:** If no dependent value is selected, the filter will show no values—depending on how it is configured.\
**Use case:** Ideal for building context-aware dropdowns that respond to earlier selections—for example, showing only Departments linked to the selected Organisation\
**Note:** Improves user experience with logical, stepwise filtering

#### 📷 QR Code Support

**What it is:** A scannable code linked to system objects for instant retrieval of details\
**Use case:** Quickly populate form fields by scanning the QR code of an asset, location, or other object\
**Note:** Speeds up data entry and minimises errors in mobile or field environments

#### 📡 NFC Support

**What it is:** Near Field Communication (NFC) technology that enables wireless data exchange with NFC tags\
**Use case:** Supports contactless reading or writing of system object information via NFC—ideal for managing inventory, property, or equipment\
**Note:** Enhances contactless workflows and improves mobile data capture accuracy
