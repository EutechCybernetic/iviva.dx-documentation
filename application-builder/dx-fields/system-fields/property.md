# 🏢Property

The **Property** field allows you to select a real estate entity or physical site already set up in the system, such as a building, estate, or residential complex. In iviva DX, properties help in identifying the specific locations where operations, services, or assets are managed.

When you fill out a form with this field, you will choose the property name from a dropdown list. That way, your record gets linked to the right property, keeping everything organised and easy to track.
