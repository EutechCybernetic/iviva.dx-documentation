🔸 **What is a Branch Office?**\
In iviva DX, a branch office represents a physical extension or subdivision of an organisation. These can be regional offices, operational sites, or satellite facilities.

🧭 **Hierarchical Context**

* **Organisation** → Parent entity
* **Branch Office** → Specific location under the organisation

This structure ensures that all records can be accurately traced to both the organisation and the relevant branch.
