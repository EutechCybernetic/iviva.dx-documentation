# 🛠️ Asset

The **Asset** field allows you to select a specific asset from a centralised list already maintained in the system. In a property and facility management platform, assets refer to anything that needs to be tracked, serviced, or maintained such as elevators, generators, HVAC units, printers, vehicles, or fire extinguishers.

The Asset field lets you choose an asset from the master list. Each record shows the asset name along with their associated location, making it easier to find and pick the correct one.

Using the Asset field, you can:

* Ensure tasks, service requests, and inspections are accurately linked to the right equipment
* Support accurate reporting, history tracking, and maintenance planning
* Eliminate the need to manually type asset names, reducing errors and improving consistency
