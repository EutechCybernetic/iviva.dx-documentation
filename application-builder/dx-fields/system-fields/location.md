# 📍 Location

The **Location** field links the form submission to a physical place defined within the system. It is essential for site-specific workflows, enabling traceability and accountability, and precise filtering across modules.

When users interact with the Location field, they will see a list of predefined locations managed in the system. This field supports hierarchical location types to provide additional context and precision:

* **Site** – Represents the top level, like a campus or regional facility
* **Building** – A structure within a site
* **Floor** – A level in a building
* **Space** – A specific room or area on a floor

This layered structure allows you to capture and organise spatial data in a meaningful way—supporting tasks like space allocation, asset tracking, and service routing.

The Location field also includes a **Layouts** tab, where you can set up spatial configuration.&#x20;

**Layouts Tab**\
This tab lets you visually map selected locations to layout plans or geographical maps. You can activate interactive layout features such as zoom and pan, enable marker popups to show summaries of the selected location, set default map views, and restrict the visible layouts using layout categories. These tools provide a visual reference for users, improving navigation and context during data entry.
