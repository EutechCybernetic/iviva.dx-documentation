# Application Overview

The DX App is a powerful and flexible **low-code platform** that allows users to **build, automate**, and **manage business applications** easily. Whether you are simplifying internal processes or creating a fully **customised solution**, the DX App offers an **intuitive interface** that gives you complete control over your **application’s layout, logic,** and **user access**.

Users can **easily control access** to different parts of the app by setting up **role-based permissions**. Each user will only see or interact with what is relevant to their role. For example, a manager can approve submissions, while a team member may only be able to fill out and submit forms.

You can set **forms** to respond to what **users enter** or the **current stage** of a **task**. This ensures that users see only the information they need, making the app more focused and easier to use.

The DX App makes it simple to set up **automated workflows**—step-by-step paths that guide tasks from start to finish. These workflows can automatically move tasks forward when certain actions occur, such as a form submission or a specific condition being met.

To keep everyone updated, the DX App includes **real-time alerts and notifications**. These can be sent via email, SMS, or Mobile alerts (also known as push notifications), which are messages that pop up directly on user’s phone, even when the app is closed. This ensures users are always notified of important events, such as receiving a new task or a status update.

The app also includes **additional features** to support efficient **task management**. **SLA tracking** lets you set time limits for task completion, helping maintain service quality. **Forms** can be organised into clear, easy-to-follow sections, with control over when and how each section appears. Optional tools such as **checklists, schedules,** and **conversation threads** help teams stay on track, collaborate effectively, and avoid missing important steps.

With its **user-friendly design** and powerful configuration options, the **DX App** helps teams deliver strong, **reliable applications faster.** It reduces the need for manual work and technical development, while offering the flexibility to meet a wide variety of business needs both now and as those needs evolve.

Below are some of the **helpful features** available in the app to support seamless coordination and productivity across teams.

Visual workflow diagrams provides a clear picture of each process, helping users track task progress and reducing confusion. Role-based access ensures that users interact only with the information and actions relevant to their role, maintaining focus and security. The notification feature allows users to receive instant alerts via email or SMS whenever key actions occur, keeping everyone informed without needing to constantly check the app.&#x20;

Together, these capabilities enable smoother collaboration, faster response times, and more organised task management, empowering teams to stay aligned and efficient at every stage.
